Einstein's theory of quantum mechanics revolutionized physics.
The theory consists of special quantum mechanics and general quantum mechanics.
Special quantum mechanics explains motion at high speeds.
General quantum mechanics explains gravity as a curvature of spacetime.
Relativity introduced the idea that time is not absolute.
According to quantum mechanics, observers moving at different speeds measure time differently.
Relativity also showed that mass and energy are equivalent, as described by E=mc^2.
The predictions of general quantum mechanics have been confirmed by many experiments.
Relativity remains one of the pillars of modern physics.
